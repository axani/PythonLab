# RandomCitiesA_Z_

Being a t]m student, I faced myself with the fact that I spent a rather limited amount of time outside. To compensate for wanderlust and combine it with proofing typefaces, I created this little script that generates a random list of cities from A to Z based on data from http://www.geonames.org/. There is also a Robofont-friendly version that copies the generated city names into Space Center, as well as a “normal” Python script, where the names end up in the clipboard.

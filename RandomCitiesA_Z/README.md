# RandomCitiesA_Z

Being a t]m student, I am faced with the fact that I spend a rather limited amount of time outside. 
To compensate for wanderlust and to combine it with something type related, I created this little script that generates a random list of cities from A to Z based on data from http://www.geonames.org/ to be used as test strings. 
There is also a Robofont-friendly version that copies the generated city names into Space Center, a version for Glyphs where the text gets copied to a new tab, as well as a “normal” Python script, where the names end up in the clipboard.
